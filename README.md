## Getting Started

### Description
The counter is initialized to the value 0. In a simple way clicking on the button + will increase the count, clicking on the - will decrease it. There are no limits, you can increase or decrease the count as much as you like.

### Prerequisites and Installation
There are no particular prerequisites or installation to do; to run the program just launch the file index.html in any search engine. The only thing is that it might not work best on Internet Explorer search engine. For others (chrome, microsoft edge ecc..) it works correctly.

### Usage
Once the program is launched, just press the + or - button to update the count. You will be able to see the change in the count in real time!

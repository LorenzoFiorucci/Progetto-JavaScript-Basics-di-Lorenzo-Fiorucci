JavaScript Basics project by Lorenzo Fiorucci - Realization of a counter using Javascript

The counter is initialized to the value 0. In a simple way clicking on the button + will increase the count, clicking on the - will decrease it. There are no limits, you can increase or decrease the count as much as you like.

### Prerequisites and Installation
There are no particular prerequisites or installation to do; the only thing is that it might not work best on the Internet Explorer search engine. For other search engines it works correctly.
